## Breaking: Async Request APIs

Not all components depend on request-specific data, so it’s unnecessary to wait for the request to render them. Headers, cookies, params, and searchParams are now asynchronous, allowing components to await, for a better and faster user experience.

```js
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function AdminPanel() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const token = cookieStore.get("token");
  //...
}
```

## Breaking: Caching

In Next.js 15, the caching default for `GET` Route Handlers and the Client Router Cache has been changed from **cached** by default to **uncached** by default. You can still opt into caching using a static route config option, such as `export const dynamic = 'force-static'`.

Page components are also no longer cached by default by the client router cache.

```js
// next.config.ts

const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
    },
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## React 19 Support

Next.js now supports React 19, currently in the release candidate version. React 19 improves handling of hydration errors.

Hydration error message in **Next.js 14.1**:

## Server Actions

Server Actions in Next.js 15 are designed to be more secure and faster through **dead code elimination** and **secure action IDs**.

```js
// app/actions.js
"use server";

// This action **is** used in our application, so Next.js
// will create a secure ID to allow the client to reference
// and call the Server Action.
export async function updateUserAction(formData) {}

// This action **is not** used in our application, so Next.js
// will automatically remove this code during `next build`
// and will not create a public endpoint.
export async function deleteUserAction(formData) {}
```

## Better Forms

The new Form component in Next.js 15 extends HTML’s form functionality, adding **prefetching**, **client-side navigation**, and **progressive enhancement** (if JavaScript hasn’t loaded, forms still work via full-page navigation).

```js
import Form from "next/form";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Form action="/search">
      <input name="query" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Turbopack Dev

`next dev --turbo` is now stable and ready in Next.js 15, offering significant performance improvements:

- Up to 76.7% faster local server startup.
- Up to 96.3% faster code updates with Fast Refresh.
- Up to 45.8% faster initial route compile without caching (Turbopack does not have disk caching yet).

## Static Route Indicator

Next.js 15 now displays an indicator on static routes to differentiate them visually.

![Static Indicator](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fblog%2Fnext-15-rc2%2Fstatic-route-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_Fu7jVfWKtfz3vjeN8JMUkr7TkYnm)

## next.config.ts

Next.js now uses `next.config.ts`, phasing out `js` and `mjs` configurations.

## Self Hosting Improvements

Next.js 15 offers more control over `Cache-Control` directives and now uses `sharp` by default when running `next start` for improved image handling.

## ESLint 9 Support

ESLint 9 is now supported in Next.js 15, ensuring compatibility with the latest linting rules and configurations.

## Enhanced Codemod CLI

Next.js 15 includes an enhanced codemod CLI for smoother upgrades within your codebase.

```sh
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest
```

Happy coding!
