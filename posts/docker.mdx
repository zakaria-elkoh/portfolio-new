## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that helps developers build, ship, and run applications in **containers**. Containers package your app's code, dependencies, and environment into a single, lightweight unit that works consistently across different systems.

### Why use Docker?

- **Consistency:** Runs the same way on your laptop, test server, or production.
- **Isolation:** Each app runs in its own container, avoiding conflicts.
- **Portability:** Move containers easily between machines or cloud providers.
- **Scalability:** Simplify deployment and scaling in microservices architectures.

## How to Dockerize a Node.js App

Below is a simple example to package a Node.js app into a Docker container.

### 1️⃣ Create `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js image as base
FROM node:20

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the code
COPY . .

# Expose port (adjust to your app's port)
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run your app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
