# A Lot Can Happen in a Year  

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that a year is more than enough time for life to change in ways you never saw coming. Time moves forward, whether we’re ready for it or not. The question is: what are we doing with it?  

Change is inevitable, but the direction it takes? That’s something we get to decide.  

Every day, we’re making choices, even if we don’t realize it. We can stay where we are—safe and comfortable—or we can step into the unknown and push ourselves to grow. Let’s be real though: change isn’t easy. It’s messy and uncomfortable. But staying the same? That comes with its own kind of discomfort—the kind you only notice when months or years go by, and nothing’s really different.  

### The Power of Starting Small  

When I first thought about making changes in my life, it felt overwhelming. Big goals can seem so far away, like they’ll take forever to reach. But here’s the thing: you don’t have to figure it all out at once. The key is to start small.  

It’s those little, consistent actions—showing up every day and doing something, no matter how small—that make the biggest difference. Over time, those small actions add up. Before you know it, you’re somewhere you never thought you’d be.  

The hardest part isn’t starting; it’s keeping at it. Some days it’ll feel like you’re making progress, and other days it’ll feel like you’re not. But if you just keep moving, even a little, you’re getting closer to where you want to be.  

### Why Change Feels Overwhelming  

The reason so many of us get stuck is because we focus on the whole picture instead of just the next step. It’s like standing at the bottom of a mountain and trying to figure out how you’ll ever make it to the top.  

The trick is to stop looking at the whole mountain. Just look at the next step. What’s one small thing you can do today? That’s all you need to focus on.  

Some days will feel effortless, and others will feel like a grind. But as long as you’re taking those steps, you’re moving forward.  

### Imagine Where You Could Be  

Take a second to think about where you could be a year from now if you started today. What habits could you build? What goals could you finally tackle? What version of yourself could you become?  

Starting can feel scary, and sticking with it can feel even harder. But once you take that first step, momentum starts to build. Each little win gives you the confidence to keep going, and before you know it, you’re in a completely different place.  

What if, instead of worrying about how far you have to go, you focused on what you can do right now? What if you celebrated the small wins along the way?  

### There’s No Perfect Time  

We all wait for the “right” time to make a change. But here’s the truth: there’s no perfect moment. You don’t need to have it all figured out. The only thing that matters is that you start.  

A year from now, you could be looking back at all the progress you’ve made and the things you’ve accomplished—or you could be exactly where you are now, still wondering what might’ve been.  

So why not take that first step today? It doesn’t have to be perfect. Just start. Trust the process, and trust yourself.

A lot can happen in a year. The choice is yours.
