## Peace.  

Being on the internet means sharing what you’re working on—and seeing what others are building too. It’s amazing, but it can also mess with your head. Take this: I came across a post about a 14-year-old building his own custom game engine. Super cool, right? But imagine being older than him and suddenly feeling like you're *behind*. That's how impostor syndrome sneaks in.  

Even me—I’m 21—and sometimes I scroll LinkedIn or X and see people winning hackathons or bagging insane internships. I wonder, “Am I doing enough?” It’s not the fault of those talented people—it’s on me. Dealing with impostor syndrome, for me, is all about mindset.  

## Why It’s a *Good* Thing  

Here’s the thing: if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.  

Impostor syndrome keeps you grounded. It reminds you that there’s always someone better, and that’s a *good* thing. Being surrounded by people who push boundaries inspires you to step up.  

This is why top colleges produce some of the most skilled people. When you’re surrounded by toppers, your *normal* gets elevated. Knowing basic data structures and algorithms in a college full of people who haven’t even heard of DSA might make you feel good, but eventually, it limits your growth. But when you see people on X or LinkedIn consistently placing high in contests or shipping cool stuff, it lights a fire under you.  

Even if the stuff isn’t groundbreaking, their *consistency* might make you wonder if you’re wasting your potential. And honestly? That little jab of self-doubt? It’s a gift.  

## The Comparison Trap

It’s natural to compare yourself to others, especially in a world where everyone’s achievements are on display. But comparison can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it pushes you to do more. On the other, it can make you feel like you’re not enough.

The key is to shift your perspective. Instead of seeing someone’s success as a measure of your shortcomings, treat it as proof of what’s possible. If they can do it, why not you? Use their journey as inspiration, not as a benchmark to beat yourself up with.

Remember: you’re running your own race. Their path isn’t yours, and their timeline isn’t a reflection of your worth. Focus on improving yourself, even if it’s just by 1% every day. Small progress compounds over time—and before you know it, you’ll be someone else’s inspiration.

## Embracing the Feeling  

Some people will tell you to brush off impostor syndrome—like it’s all in your head. But I think it’s better to lean into it. Let it drive you.  

Nobody’s born talented. Like Bob Ross said:  

> "Talent is just pursued interest."  

The key word here is *interest*. If I don’t care about something—say, machine learning—then it doesn’t matter how “behind” I feel, I’ll never be good at it. Impostor syndrome only kicks in for the stuff you genuinely care about, and that’s where it can push you to grow.  

## Don’t Panic  

Here’s what not to do: don’t freak out and assume it’s game over for you.  

If you compare yourself to someone miles ahead, of course you’ll feel like trash. Instead of stressing, focus on how you can break it down. Carve a staircase out of that steep peak.  

Set small, realistic goals. For example, if you’re trying to build a personal project, don’t aim to create a fully scalable SaaS product on day one. Start with the basics—a simple app that solves one problem well. Build from there.  

## Just Do Things  

> “What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are.”

You’re way more capable than you think.  

So just start. Your time and effort will add up. You’ll probably suck at first, but execution beats perfection. Impostor syndrome should nudge you out of your comfort zone, not paralyze you.  

Take me, for example. People often assume I’ve always been skilled at problem-solving, but it took years of practice and persistence. Every problem I tackled taught me something new and chipped away at the self-doubt.  

You don’t need a perfect routine or strict discipline to level up. Sometimes, a healthy dose of impostor syndrome is all the motivation you need.

## Final Thoughts  

Impostor syndrome isn’t something you “fix.” It’s something you live with and channel into growth. Instead of letting it weigh you down, use it to question, to learn, and to push yourself further.  

If you’re feeling it, it means you care. And that’s the first step to getting better. So embrace it, but don’t let it consume you. Stay curious, stay consistent, and remember: the only real measure of success is the progress you make every day.
